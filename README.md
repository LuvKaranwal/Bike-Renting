# Bike-Renting-
A Bike Renting Regression model, to closely predict as to many bikes will be rented at any particular day of the year. Coding implementation done in R and Python. Also attached, a comprehensive project report and Instructions to deploy and run code for better understanding of various Regression models and related graphs.

Steps to operate:

1) Both R and Python files are provided respectively to run on DOS(cmd) and Jupyter notebooks.
2) "Instructions to deploy and run code.pdf" has been provided for smmoth running of code which is helped by images of how to run R and Python files on Dos and Jupyter UI.
3) "R plots.pdf" is generated while running the R-Dos file and it contains all the graphs which are generated by R interpreter while running on DOS.
4) "day.csv" contains the sample data, on which we make certain different regression models.
5) "Comprehensive Project Report.pdf" contains all the different types of processing techniques and emphasize on individual of all the respective pre-processing and model making       techniques which are as follows:
